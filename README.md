# Marketing-attribution-project

We worked on this problem of Marketing attribution for a course project in "Advanced Database and Management Systems". This is a problem to find all the relevant "marketing touch-points" from a user's browsing history before he buys a product. Traditionally, a user used to buy all his products from nearby shops. But with the advent of mobile and e-commerce, a customer has access to e-commerce websites, ads on television, radio ads, etc. To identify which of these media led to the final purchase of the product is the problem of **Marketing attribution**.

We worked on a small attribution dataset which we had to create manually and made it as similar as possible to real-life attribution data. We optimized the query to find the relevant marketing leads on the dataset by using the database concept of joins.
